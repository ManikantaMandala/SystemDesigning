# Association

## Introduction

Objects have relationship between them in both real-life and also in
programming. Sometimes its difficult to understand the relationship.

So lets understand the one of the 3 relationship apart from Inheritance(is-a)
between objects in Java which is `Weakest` relationship.

That is!(As the heading suggestion)

ASSOCIATION

## Association

Association is the weakest relationship between the three.
**It isn't a 'has-a' relationship**, none of the objects are parts or member of
another.
