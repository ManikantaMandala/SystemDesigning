# Abstract Factory Method

## Introduction


## Problem statement

You are tasked with designing a Smart Home Device Management System that
supports multiple types of devices (e.g., Lights, Thermostats, and Speakers) and
multiple brands (e.g., BrandX and BrandY). Each brand has its own unique
implementation of these devices, but they all provide the same basic
functionalities.

The system should be flexible enough to support new types of devices or brands
in the future without modifying existing code.

## Points

* Create Smart Home Device Management System
* supports multiple types of devices (like: Lights, Thermostats, Televisions and
  Speakers)
* With multiple types of brands (like: Samsung, Xiaomi, LG)[Assume that
  these companies produces them]
* Each brand has its own unique implementation of these devices,
