# Shape Prototype

## Problem Statement

Design a system that allows creating shapes like circles and rectangles with
customizable properties (e.g., dimensions and color) and supports cloning these
shapes. Ensure that the clones are identical in properties but are independent
objects to allow modifications without affecting the originals.

## Solution
