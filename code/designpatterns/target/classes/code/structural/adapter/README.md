# Payment Gateway Integration with Multiple Banks

## Problem Statement

You are developing a payment gateway for a platform like Paytm. This gateway
needs to integrate with multiple banks, each of which provides its own unique
APIs for processing transactions (like credit card payments, UPI payments, or
net banking). These APIs vary in terms of method names, request formats, and
response structures.

To make the integration seamless, you need to design a system that:

* Allows the payment gateway to interact uniformly with different banks without
  worrying about the specific details of their APIs.
* Makes it easy to add new banks in the future with minimal changes to the
  existing system.
* Provides a consistent interface for the gateway to handle payment
  transactions.

Your task

* Use the Adapter Design Pattern to "adapt" the bank-specific APIs into a common
  interface.
* Implement a structure that enables the payment gateway to process payments
  through any integrated bank transparently.
